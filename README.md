# Mathplo_Challenge_Pymaceuticals
This file was created in Python using pandas, matplotlib and scipy.  We are attempting to clean the csv (data file).  We merged both CSV files, then cleansed the data.  We created a dataframe and used different filtering processes to extract the data that we wanted to compare.  

We charted using bar charts (both in pandas and matplotlib), we did 2 pie charts,we included a box whisker chart and we used linear regression to complete our analysis.
